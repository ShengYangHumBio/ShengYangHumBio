Class: Bioinformatics 580

Research Rationale: Title: A proteomic approach to assess the role of migratory proteins in human glioma cells.
The central nervous systemâ€™s (CNS) neural stem cell differentiation is dependent on polarity signaling which regulates cellular adhesion and motility. Cell polarity is
also responsible for asymmetrical cellular division, a process in which a stem cell divides and produces two cells. Of those two cells, one will retain its stemness 
while the other cells will have its cell fate determined by other growth factors or extracellular cues. It has been shown that when asymmetrical cell division becomes 
dysregulated cancers such as gliomas can result. Gliomas are difficult to treat because of how fast the tumors can grow and migrate out of its niche and colonize distant 
regions. 

Objective: I am interested in looking at proteins that are associated with migration of human glioma cells and how they are upregulated or downregulated. Girdin is an
actin binding protein responsible for regulating cell migration and has been shown to be upregulated in gliomas. In addition, Non-muscle Myosin II is an actin-based
motor that converts chemical energy into force and movement, and thereby is a key regulator of eukaryotic cytoskeleton. NMIIA plays a role in important processes such
as cytokinesis, surface attachment, and cell movement. It is also known to be upregulated in gliomas.

Outcomes: Determination of protein expression levels of Girdin and Non Muscle Myosin IIA in Human glioma cell line. 

Impact: I hope that by determining the expression levels of these proteins, I will have better understading of the mechansisms that underly cancer cell migration.
